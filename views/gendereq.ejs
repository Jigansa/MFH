            <p>On 18<sup>th</sup> September 2024, the Mountain Forum Himalayas (MFH) conducted an impactful awareness campaign on gender equality at the National Inter College in <span class="place">Nand Prayag</span>, under the leadership of Shri Rawat, in-charge of Himad Sanstha. The campaign aimed to address the critical issue of gender discrimination, highlighting how societal divisions between men and women can perpetuate inequality and violence against women.</p>
            <p>Through engaging visual aids and charts, participants learned that while the Constitution guarantees equality, various societal norms continue to differentiate between genders in harmful ways. The enthusiastic participation of students both boys and girls were palpable, as evidenced by photos showcasing their eagerness to engage with the topic. In a powerful demonstration of commitment, all the students took a pledge to stand against gender discrimination and to foster an inclusive environment.</p>
            <p>Smt. Bina Tiwari, a member of Jan Sangathan (People’s Organisation Changer Maahila Samiti, President), also contributed to the discussions, reinforcing the campaign’s messages. Shri Kailash Bisht, MFH animator emphasized that gender equality is a fundamental human right, asserting that discrimination undermines these rights. The gender equality awareness campaign at National Inter College marked a pivotal step towards fostering a more equitable society.</p>
            <p>By specifically targeting boys and encouraging them to rethink their attitudes towards gender issues, the campaign laid the groundwork for future advocates of change. The enthusiasm and commitment demonstrated by the students highlight the potential for a transformative shift in societal norms, paving the way for a more inclusive future. The MFH's efforts in promoting gender equality among youth are commendable and demonstrate the importance of such initiatives in shaping attitudes and behaviours towards gender issues.</p>
