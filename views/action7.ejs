        <h1>The Role of Mountain Forum Himalayas in the Mountain HUB Processes</h1>
    </div>

    <!-- Content Section -->
    <div class="content-section">
        <p>Mountain Forum Himalayas (MFH) has made significant strides in facilitating the Mountain HUB process since its inception in September 2022. A dedicated subcommittee was formed to oversee staff recruitment, resulting in the appointment of 12 field animators across 12 districts in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, alongside essential secretariat staff. A fully functional office has been established in Dehradun, enhancing operational efficiency.</p>

        <p>The coordination committee, comprised of 21 members, plays a crucial role in project planning and decision-making, with a notable representation of grassroots People’s organizations. Key accomplishments include conducting a comprehensive baseline survey covering over 5,800 families, developing a vision document for youth leaders, framing a gender policy, and creating a booklet outlining welfare schemes. The process also emphasizes inclusivity by restructuring people’s organizations to include marginalized communities and identifying 152 potential youth leaders for capacity-building initiatives.</p>

        <p>In terms of sustainable development, 10 people’s organizations have actively engaged in dialogues and advocacy processes addressing issues such as forest fires, climate change, and disaster risk reduction with various governmental departments. In Kangra district, the installation of 924 solar lights and camping lights under the "Har Ghar Roshan" mission has improved community access to energy. Furthermore, internal evaluations conducted by the coordination committee members have reinforced the ongoing efforts of these organizations.</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>Through their collective efforts, 152 women and 42 men have engaged in six models of sustainable livelihood, demonstrating the positive outcomes of collaboration within the Mountain HUB framework.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The Mountain Forum Himalayas continues to empower local communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their needs addressed, thereby fostering resilience and sustainable development in the Himalayan region. Through these efforts, MFH is actively fostering community engagement and ensuring that vulnerable populations are integrated into development processes, thereby enhancing the overall impact of the Mountain HUB initiative.</p>
